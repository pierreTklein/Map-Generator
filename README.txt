Map Generator, by Pierre Theo Klein / Evoloot

HOW TO USE:
Top left– drop down menu called “File”. First option is “Quit”. Use that to exit the map generator. Second option is “New Map”. Use that to change the average water level and the average moisture level of the map. Third option is “Random Map”. It will generate a new map with the current moisture and water levels. Fourth option is “Save Map”. It will save the current map at a desired location. Fifth is “Load Map”. It will load a previously saved map. Sixth is “Save Image”. It will take a screenshot of the current map and save it in a desired location.

Second from left– zoom! Zoom in and out of the map.

Last from left– refresh the map if the map didn’t reload properly after changing settings.
